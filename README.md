- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, here you can find some university projects. 

P.S. I am Italian so, some of my projects are in Italian.  
When I have time I will translate them into English so that they are understandable by everyone.
For now I have translated one of my projects. 
The images have writings in Italian because I am too lazy to regenerate the graphics. I prefer to use the time I have to study or do other projects.

P.P.S. The idea of â€‹â€‹using the air conditioner was mine, if you know what I'm talking about.

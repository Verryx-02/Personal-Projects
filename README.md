- 👋 Hi, I’m Francesco Verrengia, known as @Verryx-02
- 👀 I'm an aspiring programmer with no experience whatsoever. And that's why I'm here. I am a computer science student at the University of Udine.
- 🌱 I am currently learning the basics but I am confident that I will be able to continue the project by putting into practice what I am learning.
- 💞️ I'm currently creating a 3D horror game in my free time.

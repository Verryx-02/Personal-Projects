- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, here you can find some university projects.

P.S. I am Italian so, some of these projects are in Italian.  
When I have time I will translate them into English so that they are understandable by everyone.  
Here is a list of projects with a proper explanation:  
- Comparative Analysis of... is the university project of Algorithms and Data Structures.  
    It is a performance analysis of 3 algorithms for selecting the k-th element in an array:  
      QuickSelect, HeapSelect, MedianOfMediansSelect.  

- Biblioteca_Database_Project is the university project of Database.  
    It is the design and implementation of a database for a university library.

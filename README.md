- 👋 Hi, I’m Francesco Verrengia, known as @Verryx-02
- 👀 I'm an aspiring cybersecurity expert with no experience whatsoever. And that's why I'm here. I am a computer science student at the University of Udine.
- 🌱 I am currently learning the basics but I am confident that I will be able to continue the project by putting into practice what I am learning.
- 💞️ I'm currently creating a 3D horror game in my free time (I don't find it very interesting so I don't know if I'll ever finish it).
- 📫 You can contact me at francescoverrengia62442@gmail.com]

P.S. I am Italian so my projects are in Italian. When I have time I will translate them into English so that they are understandable by everyone.
For now I have translated one of my two projects. The images have writings in Italian because I am too lazy to regenerate the graphics. I prefer to use the time I have to study or do other projects.

P.P.S. The idea of ​​using the air conditioner was mine, if you know what I'm talking about.
